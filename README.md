# Atomic
Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use in Sublime Text. It consists of 16 colors selected procedurally (algorithms) and it's part of a bigger project: [Atomic](https://github.com/gerardbm/Atomic), which includes themes and color schemes for more code editors and terminal programs (NetBeans, irssi, cmus, zsh, tmux).

Why is this color scheme in a different repository instead of the main one? Because the installation in Sublime Text is easier through the Package Control, and it's a requirement: «Only include one package per repository».

### Installation

##### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have Package Control installed.
2. Choose `Install Package` from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X).
3. Select Atomic in the menu: `Preferences` > `Atomic` > `Atomic`.

With `auto_upgrade` enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

##### Manual Installation

1. Download this repository, unpack the downloaded file and manually place `Atomic.tmTheme` file into `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Atomic/`.
2. Select Atomic in the menu: `Preferences` > `Atomic` > `Atomic`.
